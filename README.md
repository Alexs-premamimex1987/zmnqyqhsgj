oh wow, just got out of seeing The Ugly Stepsister and I’m still trying to gather my thoughts... sitting here on this uncomfortable bench, there's sticky resiude of popcorn on my jacket, ugh. The movie's like – if a Dr. Seuss book and a soap opera had a baby but then gave it a sword and tossed it into a medieval fantasy setting?

> Why did they make the stepsister the sort of hero? Not really sure. But it somehow worked, her clunky armor clattering like a drumset falling down the stairs. Her character reminded me too much of my Aunt Linda during Thanksgiving dinner... determined and clumsy, with a touch of sherry-induced bravery. The theater was nuts; people munching like a mini livestock competition going on, just sheep everywhere crunching hay.

And the colors! Like someone spilled all the finger paints on a medieval tapestry. Beautiful mess. The plot twisted and looped like spaghetti on a ferris wheel — every time you think it’s gonna untangle, it knots up again. The prince was less charming and more like he belonged on a cereal box. Terrified of horses, which somehow fit in perfectly. I guess.

Oh right, remember you asked if you can download the movie? Should be able to, but honestly, it’s one of those you gotta watch the movie in a theater if you can. The chaos of it complements the chaos around you. My back’s still screaming from the lousy seats.

The villain, ha! Like a Snickers bar someone left in the sun and then tried to make it evil. Melted chocolate rage. Every line he delivered felt like he was auditioning for a perfume commercial – all brooding intensity and squinty eyes.

Words again getting away from me, might be the sugar crash from the mega soda. Anyway, give it a whirl, lose yourself in the madness. Felt like my old history lessons, bits and pieces, all lose and tangental, then swoosh – coherence!
